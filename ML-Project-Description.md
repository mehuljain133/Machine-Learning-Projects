### 1. [Classification of Arrhythmia using ECG Data]

- The goal of this project is to predict if a person is suffering from cardiac arrhythmia or not and if yes, classify it into one of 12 available groups.
- The Dataset used in this project is available at the UCI machine learning Repository. It can be found [Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia).
- The best Model was Kernelized SVM over PCA Data.
- **Accuracy achieved = 80.21%**
##   

### 2. [Diabetes-prediction]
- The objective of the project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- The data set that has used in this project has taken from the Kaggle. "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  
- Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage".
- The model best worked on this dataset is Random Forest Classifier.
- **Accuracy achieved = 98.75%**
##   

### 3. [Getting Admission in College Prediction]

- The objective of the project is to predict the chances of getting admission to a reputed University based on parameters like GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research submission.
- The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle.
- The model best worked on this dataset is Linear Regression Model.
- **Accuracy achieved = 81.08%**
##   

### 4. [Heart Disease Prediction]

- The objective of the project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has Cardiac/Heart diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset like cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, etc.
- The data set that has used in this project is taken from the Kaggle.
- The model best worked on this dataset is Random Forest Classifier with n_estimators=90.
- **Accuracy achieved = 83.82%**
##   

### 5. [Iris Flower Classification]

- The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width. 
- The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
- The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers or, in other words, one which exhibits good generalization.
- The model best worked on this dataset is Support Vector Classifier..
- **Accuracy achieved = 98%**
##   

### 6. [Loan Repayment Prediction]

- Predicts whether the bank should approves the loan of an applicant based on his profit using _Ensemble Learning Methods_.
- The data set that has used in this project is taken from the Kaggle.
- The model best worked on this dataset is Random Forest Classifier with n_estimators=600.
- **Accuracy achieved = 84.75%**
##   

### 7. [Predict Employee Turnover]

- It is a guided Project.
- The Objective of this project is to predict Employee Churn using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers.
- The Dataset is taken From guided project Course available at Coursera named _Predict-Employee-Turnover-with-scikit-learn_.
- **Accuracy achieved = 97%**
##   

### 8. [Wine Quality Prediction]

- The Objective of the project is to predict the quality of the Wine based on different features present in the dataset.
- The data set that has used in this project is taken from the Kaggle.
- The model best worked on this dataset is Random Forest Classifier with n_estimators=100.
- **Accuracy achieved = 90.31%**
